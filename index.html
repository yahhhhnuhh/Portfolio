         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Hi, I'm Julliana Onor, a 2nd-year BS Computer Science student at Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao, currently building the foundations of my tech journey. I’ve developed my first Java application and am now diving into frontend development to create my first web projects. I’m passionate about leadership and love being involved in clubs and organizations, and I currently serve as the President of the Computing Students' Society, the student body organization of CCIS, where I lead initiatives that support and empower computing students.</p>
